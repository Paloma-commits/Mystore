# Mystore

Welcome to my first angular app! It is a small hiking app where you can select some basic necessities to gear up for the mountain... 

# Setting up
Feel free to clone my repo, download all the depencies and serve the app. Steps:
  1. Clone
  2. npm i 
  3. ng build
  4. ng serve --port 3000 (or of your choosing)
  5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
  
# How the store works
  - Add items using the button and quantity selector, it will not let you add an item unless a quantity has been selected. The app will share messages as you    interact with it. 
  - Once you have added items feel free to check what you have in the cart so far and delete on that screen or modify quantities back on the home page

# Screens Included
- Home page with list of products
- Detailed screen for each product
- Cart screen 
- Checkout 
- Confirmation page
